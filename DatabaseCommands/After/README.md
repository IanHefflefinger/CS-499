# NoSQL Commands

## About:
NoSQL Commands is a script I wrote in early 2022. It is a JavaScript that creates a database, three collections (similar to tables in SQL), and seeds each collection with relevant data (the same data in the SQL database). This script does not define a schema as that is done by the client.

## Usage:
*This application requires MongoDB to work as expected  
1. dowload the folder
2. run `mongo NoSQL-Commands.js` to execute the script
3. check the database using the MongoDB shell to see the newely created database, collections, and data
