# SQL Commands

## About:
SQL Commands was a script I wrote in DAD-220 Introduction to SQL back in 2019. It is an SQL script that creates a database, three tables inside the database, and then seeds the tables with data (relating to the table). The script also defines the schema for the database (it decides what and how the data is entered).

## Usage:
*This application requires MySQL to work as expected  
1. start MongoDB
2. run `source <location where you downloaded file to>/SQL_Commands.sql`
