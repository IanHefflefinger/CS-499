### Software Design and Engineering

#### Project: [Steve's Mower Repair Services](https://github.com/IanHefflefinger/CS-499/tree/master/StevesWebsite)

#### Narrative: 

Steves Mower Repair Services is a website that I initially created for IT-270: Web Site Design in early 2021. It was a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript website that represented a fictional mower-repair business owned and operated by a man named, “Steve”. This website was strictly a front-end website that did not include a server.

The enhanced version of the website is a full-stack application with a Node.js/Express.js back-end. The enhanced application also contains several design modifications, security improvements, and features. The enhanced version of the site contains the same content (with a few exceptions) as the initial site, but with a functioning back-end. This site was created in March of 2022.

I selected this artifact because I knew I could significantly improve upon it. The initial application was strictly HTML/CSS/JavaScript and I knew enough about Node.js/Express to host it on a server. I also felt the website could be easily modified to look more presentable and to render information more appropriately. 

This site now contains a fully functioning form with client-side validation that sends a POST request to a server with server-side validation. The form renders a success page once the server receives and validates the request. The site also uses Bootstrap on the front-end so styling and UI features could be implemented more easily. Bootstrap also allowed for the site to be more mobile-friendly and now the site includes a nabber that can be used on a mobile-sized device. The site also no longer has resizing issues with the images, cards, and navigation bar.

The enhanced version of the site uses ejs on the backend to allow for templating - this significantly DRY’s up the code and allows for uniform headers and footers on each page. The templating engine ejs also allows for much easier dynamic rendering of data on each page and lays a foundation for a more dynamic future for the site (ejs could allows for a lot of future opportunities with each page). 

The planned outcome-coverage for these assignments are, “Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database)”. This assignment specifically was meant to meets the goals of Software Design and Engineering. The enhanced artifact absolutely met the criteria for Software Design and Engineering. 

This enhanced application has visual design changes that are obvious improvements to the user interface. The mobile-first enhancement is a far better design and is more user-friendly. Adding Bootstrap allowed for a better user experience (especially with the navigation bar on mobile devices). The form is significantly enhanced and provides validation on the client and server levels. Images now render and resize appropriately and content within the pages reacts correctly to resizing.

Migrating the site to the back-end took engineering skills and allowed for an application that can actually be accessed by end-users in remote locations. Features were added on the back-end to allow the form to actually be useful and validate data before returning an appropriate response to the user. The back-end of the site uses Node.js/Express.js as a server-language/framework - this is a rising technology that is in high demand.

As I was improving this website, I ran into several issues with the new features I was adding and the updated styling. I initially ran into issues with Express.js and it’s router module where I was not able to render any pages except root and users but I was able to resolve the issue after some time on Stack Overflow. I also ran into issues with implementing actual functioning to the form. For the form validation, I used a package (express-validator) who’s documentation referenced dependancies that are now integrated with Express, so I had to modify the base code to omit some information that was outdated. All of the other issues I ran into were fairly straightforward to resolve. I learned a fair amount about Express.js, Bootstrap, and CSS throughout the process. For example, I learned that multiple views can be rendered to a single URL (this proved useful with the form pages success message).
