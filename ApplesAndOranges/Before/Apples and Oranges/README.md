# Apples and Oranges

## About:
Apples and Oranges was an application I initially wrote in my IT-145 Foundations in Application Development course. It was a simple application that asked the user how many apples and oranges were in stock, how many needed to be in stock, and calculated the difference and showed the user how many needed to be ordered. It was a very simple application that served mostly as a module to teach about java variables and basic input/output.

## Usage:
*This application will not compile, atm, as the class and file name differ  
*This application requires Java and a corresponding JDK to work  
1. Download the folder and cd into it
2. Compile the folder (won't work, but instructions are provided for reference): `javac applesAndOranges.java`
3. Run `java applesAndOranges`
