# Steves Mower Repair Services

## About:
Steves Mower Repair Services is an updated full-stack website that I initially created for IT-270: Web Site Design in early 2021 and redesigned in March of 2022 for CS-499: Computer Science Capstone. It is a  website that represents a fictional mower-repair business owned and operated by a man named, “Steve” (also fictional). The updated website uses Node.js/Express.js as a server-language/framework with several packages (ejs, express-validator, etc.) to help perform needed functions. The front-end of the site primarily uses Bootstrap and has a fully functional form that communicates with the server (validation is present on both the front-end and the back-end). The front-end of the site contains the same content as the old site, but with slightly re-arranged/added HTML, new CSS, and Bootstrap.
