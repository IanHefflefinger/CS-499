# Steves Mower Repair Services

## About:
Steves Mower Repair Services is a website that I initially created for IT-270: Web Site Design in early 2021. It is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript website that represented a fictional mower-repair business owned and operated by a man named, “Steve” (also fictional). This website is strictly vanilla (no frameworks or libraries) front-end with no server.
